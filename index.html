                    <h2>Their Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        It was a warm fall evening the night fate brought Jeff and Molly together.
                        She had been in DC the night before, and was hesitant to hit the town for a second night.
                        Meanwhile, he was bright eyed and bushy tailed for his second night out in Baltimore.
                        She decided though, that since it was a close friend’s birthday she would muster the
                        energy to tackle the night scene one more time. Luck would have it that they had a mutual
                        friend, of whom Jeff was running around with on that indian summer evening. That friend eventually
                        gave Molly a call to hang out with him and a mysterious friend of his own. They met. Sparks flew.
                        And the rest is history.

                    <h2>The Proposal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Molly had been pestering Jeff to take her to a Ballet for years. She knew it was a lost cause,
                        but playfully joked about it again and again, secretly hoping he might cave. On their 3rd anniversary
                        Jeff surprised her with a trip to see the Nutcracker in NYC, with a proud smile on his face,
                        internally boasting about how great of a boyfriend he was for muscling through a ballet. She
                        suspected it was because he had run out of gift ideas. Nevertheless, they made it to the Big
                        Apple in early December, and after sitting through a flawless performance at the Lincoln Center,
                        Jeff dropped to one knee outside of the building, under the bright lights, in the pouring rain.
                        It was perfect. She cried. She said yes. And that is why you are all here.

                        where the bon fire will be held, and skates can be rented inside the lodge. There will
                        also be horse-drawn sleigh rides available to all of our guests that evening!

                        We would love to see a lot of our friends and family in one place! However, there are plenty of other

                        Yes, they are a little crazy.  This is no secret.  But, trust them, the venue and the surrounding area are awesome.  They really hope you can make it.  A fun time will be had by all that attend!
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="question">No, Seriously, Why Canada in February?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Many moons ago, Molly and an unruly band of high school teenagers used to hop on a charter bus and make the long trip up to Mont Tremblant Resort over a long holiday weekend.  She made many lasting memories on those ski trips with her friends and has been searching for an excuse to go back ever since.

                        Over the years, Jeff has travelled far and wide in pursuit of powder days on the mountain.  From trips out west with college and highschool buddies to day trips to the local resorts with his brothers and friends, he rarely turned down an opportunity to hit the slopes.

                        When Jeff and Molly started dating, it was only natural that their first trip together would be to Salt Lake City to visit close friends and ride the steep descents of the Rockies.  I guess you could say that they both share a soft spot in their hearts for snowy mountain towns and hope you do too.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="question">Can we bring the munchkins?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes, kids are welcome.  Jeff and Molly are both from large families and would love to have little ones involved in the festivities.  Le Grand Lodge and the Tremblant Village are both very family friendly and include many activities for kids.  If you’d rather leave the kids with Grandma and Grandpa and get your swerve on, that’s cool too.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="question">Do I need a passport?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Yes, you need a passport to travel to Canada.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="question">What should we bring?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Warm clothes.  The wedding ceremony and reception will be inside the lodge where it’s warm and cozy but you’ll definitely want to bundle up for any outdoor activities.  Bring any ski/snowboard equipment if you plan on hitting up the mountain.  If you’re interested in ice skating, you can bring skates.  These items can also be rented if you don’t have them.  Bring a bathing suit if you’d like to hang out in the lodge’s pool or hot tub.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="question">How long should we stay?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">
                        We recommend arriving some time on (or before) Thursday, Feb 4th, 2016 to participate in the pre-wedding festivities.  The wedding ceremony and reception will be on Friday, Feb 5th, 2016.  Following the day of the wedding, you are welcome to spend a few extra days at the lodge or in the village.  You are also welcome to explore some of the surrounding cities like Montreal, Quebec City, and Ottawa.  Stay as long as you’d like.  Jeff and Molly will be staying in the Tremblant area for at least a few days to enjoy the attractions and activities.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="question">What's the attire?</h2>
                    <p class="answer">
                        For the bonfire, we encourage you to dress casually and warmly.  We want for everyone to be comfortable.  For the ceremony and reception, the attire is semi-formal.  Don’t worry, you won’t have to go outside for this.
