                    <p>
                        It was a warm fall evening the night fate brought Jeff and Molly together.
                        She had been in DC the night before, and was hesitant to hit the town for a second night.
                        Meanwhile, he was bright eyed and bushy tailed for his second night out in Baltimore.
                        She decided though, that since it was a close friend’s birthday she would muster the
                        energy to tackle the night scene one more time. Luck would have it that they had a mutual
                        friend, of whom Jeff was running around with on that indian summer evening. That friend eventually
                        gave Molly a call to hang out with him and a mysterious friend of his own. They met. Sparks flew.
                        And the rest is history.

                    <h2>The Proposal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Molly had been pestering Jeff to take her to a Ballet for years. She knew it was a lost cause,
                        but playfully joked about it again and again, secretly hoping he might cave. On their 3rd anniversary
                        Jeff surprised her with a trip to see the Nutcracker in NYC, with a proud smile on his face,
                        internally boasting about how great of a boyfriend he was for muscling through a ballet. She
                        suspected it was because he had run out of gift ideas. Nevertheless, they made it to the Big
                        Apple in early December, and after sitting through a flawless performance at the Lincoln Center,
                        Jeff dropped to one knee outside of the building, under the bright lights, in the pouring rain.
                        It was perfect. She cried. She said yes. And that is why you are all here.
